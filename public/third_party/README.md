This directory stores third-party libraries used by the frontend. Files that are in folders are guaranteed to be third-party.
Files in the root of this directory are either single-file third-party libraries, or are our custom modifications and/or glue code.
So if you do something like a `grep -r` while in the process of renaming something, or when tracking where a certain style or javascript
behaviour is coming from, make sure to also check out the files in the root directory in this folder!
